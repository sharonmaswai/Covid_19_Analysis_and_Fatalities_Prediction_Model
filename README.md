## Description


This is an analysis and modeling of the COVID_19 data with an aim of getting insights from the analysis and creating a prediction model to predict fatalities

## Context

What is Covid19?

COVID-19(Corona Virus, Discovered in 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by a new virus. Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat and shortness of breath. The virus can spread from person to person, but good hygiene can prevent infection.


From Related Information about COVID-19,

COVID-19 may not be fatal but it spreads faster than other diseases, like common cold. Every virus has Basic Reproduction number (R0) which implies how many people will get the disease from the infected person. As per inital reseach work R0 of COVID-19 is 2.7.

Currently the goal of all scientists around the world is to "Flatten the Curve". COVID-19 currently has exponential growth rate around the world which we will be seeing in the notebook ahead. Flattening the Curve typically implies even if the number of Confirmed Cases are increasing but the distribution of those cases should be over longer timestamp. To put it in simple words if say suppose COVID-19 is going infect 100K people then those many people should be infected in 1 year but not in a month.

The sole reason to Flatten the Curve is to reudce the load on the Medical Systems so as to increase the focus of Research to find the Medicine for the disease.

Every Pandemic has four stages:

Stage 1: Confirmed Cases come from other countries

Stage 2: Local Transmission Begins

Stage 3: Communities impacted with local transimission

Stage 4: Significant Transmission with no end in sight

Italy and Korea are the two countries which are currently in Stage 4 While India is in Stage 2.

Other ways to tackle the disease like Corona other than Travel Ban, Cross-Border shutdown, Ban on immigrants are Testing, Contact Tracing and Quarantine.
